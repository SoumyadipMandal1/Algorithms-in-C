Hello,

I am trying to make all the algorithms in C in this Github repository.
I had written some algorithms. But there are problems with these.

It would be helpful if someone

- Finds bugs
- Finding optimizations 
- Advices to make the code more readable by adding comments, docstrings or changing variable
- Finding me a way to pass default parameter as input in C. By which, I can do `reverse = false` in sorting algorithms.
- Finding me a way to pass an array to a function such that its value passes into the function and not the pointer

I want to make this repository 100 % in C.
